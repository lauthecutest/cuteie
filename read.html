        <p>i know ur asleep but i cant wait for u to wake up so ima js type it instead and u can read it when ur up but i
            just wanna say that i dont think i can just be friends with you because i fucking love you so much more than
            u could ever imagine! i wanna be with you 24/7 like no joke all ive been thinking about since we started
            talking again is u and i know i blocked u so many times but i only did that because i knew if i started
            talking to u again i would js fall in love with u and i cant help it and i think i will always love you no
            matter what you do or say to me no matter how bad it is and u make me the happiest ive been in a while with
            singing ur sily ass songs and the way u say my name when u try to be like my mom and when u try to say u
            love me in hungarian or just when u talk about anything literally it all makes me smile so hard but when u
            talk about other girls and u wanna make me mad with it doesnt work because i get jealous instead even though
            we arent together and i have no say in who u talk about or talk to so i js say okay to make it seem like i
            dont care when i really do like id kill them literally because ur supposed to be with me and im not just
            saying that because im delusional im saying it because i actually mean it and want it to be that way and i
            know u probably dont feel that way towards me and u couldnt care less about what im saying rn but i dont
            ever wanna lose u or stop talking to u ever again because u mean the world to me and always have even when
            we werent talking but to the point i wanna be with u like in a relationship not just friends because u
            talking about other girls makes me wanna go insane and the thought of them having u or even talking to u
            pisses me off and i just want u back i dont care if u play me i dont care if ur being a bitch to me i dont
            care about any of it if it means i get to be with u so please think about it and lets just get back together
            for the love of god and if u dont wanna just say it!</p>
